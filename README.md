## Project Overview
STPP - Vem Gratuidade is a Web-based Application designed to address the specific needs of indiviuals with free tickets cards, such as those with disabilities, elderly individuals and chidren.
The primary purpose is to manage the unlocking process for cards that have been suspended due to rule violations.

To facilitate travel on the metro or bus public system, individuals require a Public Transportation Card (Catao Vem). 
### Browse through the website, register, log in and start porcessing unlocking requests.

## Click **Quick Guide** link at the top left of the screen and view the steps to complete a unlock request submitted by a transport user.  

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

**Why the Project is Distinct:**
This project stands out for its direct response to a real and specific issue within the public transportation system. It tackles the complexity of enforcing laws related to freee benefits by incorporating dynamic rules thta vary based on card type, frequency of rule violarions, and card holder eligibility.

**Complex Aspects:**
The complexity lies in the nuanced enforcement of four infractiions, each with its own penalty. The rules for unlocking the card are dynamically generated based on the type of infringement, providing a tailored agreement for the cardholder.

### File Contents

- **JavaScript File:** 
Contains logic for law rule application to display data accurately.
- **Python Files:** 
Encompass server-side logic for entering and retrieving card and law rules data, managing unlock dates, request statuses and card statuses. Includes dynamic construction of agreement terms based on cardholder and law information.
- **Django Models:** 
Include the necessary database structures for authenticating staff, searching cardholder information, and generating agreements for card users to sign.
- **HTML and CSS Files:** 
Comprise the user interface code for creatig an one-page app and navigating through the unlocking process.

### Admin
---

**Admin access** - Admin interface for the IT support to change or update laws rules and user permissions

### Limitations

We need to integrate the STPP application with the State of Pernmabuco's cloud system. 
Card copies requests rules is not available, due to payment system not integrated with the State Departmente system yet.
The application works with sensitive data sent by the data provider's servers. These data are not available for investigation. On the other hand, all legislation can be consulted during beta tests.
Content Management is avalilabe for changing texts in your user main main page only. In future versions, a complete content management will be implemented as well as a news feed.

### Additional Information

The project aims to address potential legal issues related to card locking and unlocking systems. It envisions future versions allowing cardholders to use a mobile app for unlocking, requesting card coies, challenging suspensions, and storing documents in the cloud.


## Introduction

To use public transportation, individuals require a Cart√£o Vem, which is freely provided for children, elderly individuals, and people with disabilites. Violations of usage lead to card suspension, with penalties varying based on the number of infractiions. This applications facilitates the monitoring and enforcement of suspension periods

## Problem to Solve or Mitigate

The project aims to address potential legal issues arising from card locking and unlocking systems. The focus i son preventing unjust suspensions, especially for elderly individuals an people with disabilities who may seek justice for damages caused by card suspensions.

## Test Version (CS50) Version)

The test version serves as a platform for the Consortium Agency to collect agreement signatures, provide instructions on locking/unlocking procedures, and set unlock dates according to suspension rules. Daily reports are generated and sent to operators and agendy staff to track unlocking requests and identify infriging cards.

## New versions

Future versions aim to allow cardholders to install a mobile app, accept agreement terms online, and request unlocking services without visiting a public agency. This approach reduces agency size and associated costs.
Additional features include requesting card copies, obtaining extra free tickets, challenging suspensions through administrative proceedings, and sotring all documents in the cloud.
